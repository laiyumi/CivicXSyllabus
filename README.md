# Civic X Syllabus

## Overview

Civic X Syllabus is a project developed at the NU-Wellesley Child Care Policy Lab at Northeastern University. It is a platform designed to curate resources that build foundational civic innovation knowledge for educators, policy teams, and civic enthusiasts.


## My Role

The original site was built on WordPress but faced several challenges:
- Outdated data and poor maintainability.
- People in Lab do not have coding knowledge, struggled to manage the site using WordPress.
