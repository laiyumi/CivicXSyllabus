        <p>
          ‘Civic X’ is an umbrella term that we have adopted to describe the
          body of debated and debatable knowledge produced as part of the civic
          research, civic data, civic technology, and civic design spaces.
          ‘Civic’ is the core principle that unites all of the resources
          collected in this space: folx who produce and/or use these resources
          are likely focused on producing something toward a civic or public
          good. The ‘X’ denotes any or all of the different words that follow
          ‘Civic.’ And a ‘syllabus’ is a tool used to organize resources for the
          purposes of learning.

        <h2 className="text-2xl">Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          ‘Civic X Syllabus’ is a play on ‘Civic’ and the way people do
          collaborations using ‘X’ as a conjunction. Ha! 😁 All in all, ‘Civic X
          Syllabus’ seeks to democratize thought leadership in the civic
          innovation space by curating respected and high-quality civic
          innovation resources searchable by resource type and topic. We build
          and maintain ‘Civic X Syllabus’ with civic researchers, students,
          educators, civic/policy teams, and civic enthusiasts in mind.
