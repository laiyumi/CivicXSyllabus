                    Dr. Samantha Patel is an experienced professor at a leading
                    university specializing in public administration. She seeks
                    to enrich her students&apos; learning experiences by
                    providing them with real-world examples of how civic

                    The fragmented nature of available civic innovation
                    resources forces Dr. Patel to spend a considerable amount of
                    time piecing together content from various sources. This
                    makes it difficult for her to keep her course materials
                    current and relevant.
