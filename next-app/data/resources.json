    "excerpt": "This cyberseminar explores innovative qualitative methods in health research, beyond interviews and focus groups, highlighting their advantages, disadvantages, and suitability for understanding individual and system-level influences on stakeholder behavior.",
    "content": "Over the past decade, qualitative methods have become increasingly integrated into health services research. However, the most common qualitative approaches remain those that involve data collection via interviews and focus groups. This cyberseminar provides an introduction to newer and more innovative qualitative approaches that may be less well known to health researchers but which allow additional insights into individual- and system-level factors that influence stakeholder perspectives and behaviors. The advantages and disadvantages of each approach will be discussed so that researchers can determine the appropriate methodological choice for their needs.",
