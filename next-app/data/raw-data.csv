","Joshua Tauberer’s article on democratic reform stresses that the core issues are societal and institutional, not merely technological. He argues that technology alone can’t solve the problems of democracy because it often excludes marginalized groups who lack access to digital tools. Effective reform involves addressing power dynamics and understanding democracy as a collective human project. Tauberer highlights the importance of inclusivity and cautions against relying on tech solutions that might exacerbate inequalities. His perspective encourages reformers to focus on building social and institutional frameworks that empower all citizens, particularly the most vulnerable.

","The New Yorker article “Slow Ideas” by Atul Gawande explores why some innovative ideas and technologies take a long time to gain traction and be adopted, even when they promise significant improvements. Gawande contrasts the rapid spread of certain advancements, like smartphones, with the slow adoption of beneficial medical practices and technologies. He attributes this delay to factors such as resistance to change, entrenched habits, and the complexity of implementing new practices in established systems. The article examines case studies, including the spread of hand hygiene practices in hospitals, to illustrate how understanding and addressing these barriers can help accelerate the adoption of transformative ideas.

","The purpose of the present research was to test a model on the role of passion for work in professional burnout. This model posits that obsessive passion produces conflict between work and other life activities because the person cannot let go of the work activity. Conversely, harmonious passion is expected to prevent conflict while positively contributing to work satisfaction. Finally, conflict is expected to contribute to burnout, whereas work satisfaction should prevent its occurrence. This model was tested in 2 studies with nurses in 2 cultures. Using a cross-sectional design, Study 1 (n=97) provided support for the model with nurses from France. In Study 2 (n=258), a prospective design was used to further test the model with nurses from the Province of Quebec over a 6-month period. Results provided support for the model. Specifically, harmonious passion predicted an increase in work satisfaction and a decrease in conflict. Conversely, obsessive passion predicted an increase of conflict. In turn, work satisfaction and conflict predicted decreases and increases in burnout changes that took place over time. The results have important implications for theory and research on passion as well as burnout.

Community-engaged research (CEnR) is increasingly promoted in the literature, and academic programs with a community-academic partnership focus. Community-based participatory research (CBPR) is an approach to frame equitable community involvement in research and is a critical component of the CEnR continuum. As with CEnR, noted benefits of using CBPR expressed in the literature, which include enhancing the relevance and application of the research data, expertise to complex problems at all stages of research, overcoming community distrust, and improving community health. This article presents a community engagement (CE) model that includes seven defined designations for CEnR. In addition, this model includes equity indicators and contextual factors for consideration at the various levels of engagement along the continuum.\nMethods: The CE model described in this article combines the principles of CE and CBPR in conjunction with a continuum model. The continuum integrates a focus on health equity and contextual factors providing perspectives from both community and academic partners at each point of engagement.\nConclusions: A broadly defined CEnR continuum will allow researchers, community members and organizations to readily identify 1) where they are on the continuum of CEnR, 2) appropriate access points to enter the continuum based on existing contextual factors, and 3) actions to promote progression on the continuum. Funders have the opportunity to specify the appropriate level of CE needed to accomplish the goals of their identified priorities.

","The Medium article, written by Josh Gee, shares insights into the challenges and learnings derived from two years of moving government forms online. The process includes digitizing a diverse range of forms, from simple requests to more complex grant applications. Key learnings include the need for ease-of-use in form design, reduction of jargon to improve accessibility and understanding, and enhancement of customer service experiences. Iteration is important – and should be based on user feedback to constantly improve the system. He also emphasized the usefulness of metrics to track success and identify improvements and highlighted policy and procurement as areas in need of innovation to facilitate digitization.

","Because computers zoom across magnifications, it is easy to conclude that both knowledge and things exist by nature in precision-nested scales. The technical term is “scalable,” the ability to expand without distorting the framework. But it takes hard work to make knowledge and things scalable, and this article shows that ignoring nonscalable effects is a bad idea. People stumbled on scalable projects through the same historical contingencies that such projects set out to deny. They cobbled together ways to make things and data self-contained and static, and thus amenable to expansion. In European New World plantations, the natives were wiped out; coerced and alienated plants and workers came to substitute for them. Profits were made because extermination and slavery could be discounted from the books. Such historically indeterminate encounters formed models for later projects of scalability. This essay explores scalability projects from the perspective of an emergent “nonscalability theory” that pays attention to the mounting pile of ruins that scalability leaves behind. The article concludes that, if the world is still diverse and dynamic, it is because scalability never fulfills its own promises.
